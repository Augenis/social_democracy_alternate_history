= International Trade

# unfinished
International trade accounts for only a small sliver of our gross domestic product, and most of it is conducted with socialist countries in the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance, or COMECON. The imperialist Western powers claim that our products are lower quality and unmarketable. Still, despite nominally only making up a few percentages of our economy, trade with the West and independent states is important as it is the only way we can acquire certain goods and needed grain.

We have opened up our economy to Western imports somewhat, and certain American and European companies jump on the chance of selling cheap goods to an untapped foreign market. We argue that this is merely a case of the capitalists selling us the rope with which we will hang them - yet it doesn't seem like we're benefitting as much as we think - after all, the Westerners are still uninterested in buying our production and we thus resort to hard currency purchases or selling raw materials.

Still, it is popular (except among the hardliners) and provides an influx of Western goods for select stores.

We have expanded trade ties with our allies in the Eastern Bloc and countries of socialist orientation in Africa and Asia. Because of their small markets and our overwhelming size, they cannot rescue our economy by themselves, but their societies will appreciate this. [? if china_comecon = 1 : However, growing trade with our new allies in China has provided our economy a much needed boost. ?]

Foreign trade in the Union is centralized under the Ministry of Foreign Trade, which has a monopoly on negotiating and signing contracts with foreigners and make foreign trade plans. Trade is planned, approval for trade deals is slow, contract negotiations are delayed and covered with layers of bureaucracy, corruption and petty supervision.

We have begun clearing out this rot, reforming or disestablishing unnecessary bureaucratic layers and making it easier for enterprises to form trade deals in a reasonable timeframe, which is already having a positive impact on the economy. [? if rb_strength > 64 : Unfortunately, because of enormous corruption, much of this effect has been minimized, and corrupt officials have begun abusing the freer trade system to siphon wealth. ?]

We previously stayed out of capitalist international trade agreements for obvious reasons, but perhaps there's no reason to be left out? We have formally requested observer status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and started working on joining other existing pacts and deals worldwide. Western observers laud your decision and believe that 'the Reformer' is willing to put the Cold War era confrontation to rest. This, however, requires us to liberalize our trade policies somewhat and is hardly supported by the conservatives in the Party leadership.

# negative effects in Afghanistan

We have decided to cut down on our lavish financial and military support for numerous aligned movements in the socialist sphere and the Third World. This is seen by the West as a step forward for international peace, but also surrenders a lot of our positions in Africa, Asia and the Americas, and is obviously despised by interventionist members of our party.

@stay_course

There's no harm in that. The Union needs to be self sufficient, not rely on trade with the bourgeoisie.
